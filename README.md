IoT Project: Sending SMS using SIM900A and ESP8266
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 and SIM900A GSM module to send SMS messages. The ESP8266 is used as a microcontroller to communicate with the SIM900A module and send SMS messages.

Hardware Components Required:
ESP8266 Development Board
SIM900A GSM Module
Breadboard
Jumper wires
5V Power supply
Wiring Diagram
Here is the wiring diagram for the ESP8266 and SIM900A module:

Copy code
ESP8266            SIM900A
TX                 RX
RX                 TX
3.3V               VCC
GND                GND
Software Required
Arduino IDE
Libraries Required
SoftwareSerial (to enable serial communication between ESP8266 and SIM900A)
Adafruit FONA Library (to send SMS messages using SIM900A module)
Steps
1.Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.
2.Open the Arduino IDE and install the required libraries mentioned above.
3.Open a new sketch and include the libraries.
4.Create a new SoftwareSerial object to establish serial communication between ESP8266 and SIM900A module.
5.Initialize the SIM900A module by sending AT commands through SoftwareSerial.
6.Check if the SIM900A module is responding correctly.
7.Send an SMS message using the Adafruit FONA library.
8.Upload the code to the ESP8266 development board.
9.Open the Serial Monitor and check the output for any errors.
10.Test the project by sending a message from your phone to the SIM900A module.
Conclusion
In this project, we demonstrated how to send SMS messages using an ESP8266 and SIM900A GSM module. By using this project as a base, you can build on top of it and create more complex IoT projects using GSM communication.
